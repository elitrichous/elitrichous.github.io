There are also bleachers in the background filled with teams of high schoolers cheering on their robots.

I organized gaming events for the Sandbox Symposium as a part of SIGGRAPH in 2006 in Boston, 2007 in San Diego, 2008 in L.A., and 2009 in New Orleans.

Here are some videos the team produced under my mentorship while applying for the FRC Chairman's Award:
