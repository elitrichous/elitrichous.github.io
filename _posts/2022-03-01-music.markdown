The image shows a sign promoting my family's performance at the Water Hill Music Festival. We call ourselves the Nintendoland Family Band, and we play covers of videogame music that I love to arrange. Below you'll find playlists of our sets at the 4 years we performed at the festival!

If you're just going to play one Nintendoland Family Band Video, make it this one! Audi Famam Illius from Super Smash Bros Brawl, our Finale from our 2015 set.

I've also arranged pieces performed by the University of Michigan Youth Euphonium and Tuba Ensemble. I wrote a Brass Quintet in High School titled "Little Bunny Foo Fugue" that I still hope to have performed someday!
