Here's all the text (and a bit more) that appears on slides in this slide deck.

Hello, I’m Eli.

My background is in Architecture, IT, Music, Comedy, and Puppetry,

and my experience includes Writing, Financial , Personnel & Facilities Management, Event Production, AV Production, and of course Libraries.

I was first hired at AADL in August 1997 as a Helpdesk Technician. Then I worked as:
- Desktop Engineer
- Systems Planner / Advanced Content Designer (I made up that title myself!)
- Network Administrator
- IT Manager
- Associate Director of IT & Production
- And I’ve been Deputy Director since 2014.

So, to frame up the Library Sci-fi you’re about to hear:

- I won’t be talking about specific partners 
- I won’t be talking about specific buildings
- I won’t be talking about the strategic plan
- I (mostly) won’t be talking about numbers

- I will be talking about things we *could* do
and things that *could* happen in the world
and how the library might respond
and how things will be ok.

So with that….

### Phonocalypse - August 2026
A sudden, constant flood of spam calls besieges any phone number, making voice calls unusable.

Webapps launch like InstaYak, howRya, TINCAN, Moshi, Fonecal, and Lotus Dialer

AADL Launches New Correspondence Services for those unable to use new phone alternatives.

### Facebookalypse - September 2026
A swarm of false traffic from real but dormant facebook accounts floods everyone’s feed with gibberish.

AADL Launches new in-person and at-home social / informative events for those most affected. 

### Adpocalypse - October 2026
The IoT botnet comes for the ad serving, tracking, and federating industry. Local News Outlets are Liquidated as the Private Equity that owns them decides they’re no longer profitable enough.

AADL creates a community newsroom and adds staff positions and tech resources to support it.

### Cryptopocalypse - December 2026
Cryptocurrency exchange sites are knocked offline as fast as they can be brought up. Bitcoin and ETH crash.

No Impact on AADL or new services required.

Credit for these 4 Apocalypses is taken by an anticapitalist hacker collective calling itself the Horsemen, using cartoon character Bojack Horseman as their signature meme. So yes, it is the Four Apocalyses of the Horsemen.
